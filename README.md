This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of a CSV dataset from a Kaggle competition, focusing on insights related to the professions of Data Analytics and Data Engineering, including the technologies they use. The dataset is analyzed to uncover trends, skill requirements, and other valuable insights. The EDA process leads to the creation of an interactive dashboard, which is built and deployed using Tableau to visualize the findings.
